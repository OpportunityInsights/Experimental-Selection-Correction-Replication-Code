# Experimental-Selection-Correction-Replication-Code
Replication Code for Athey, Chetty, and Imbens (2025)

This repository contains replication code for the working paper *"The Experimental Selection Correction Estimator: Using Experiments to Remove Biases in Observational Estimates"*.

The R code provided implements our experimental selection correction method that demonstrate how experimental data can be used to debias observational treatment effect estimates.

### Repository Structure

* All code is contained in the `code/` folder.
* The two main scripts are:

  * `ESC_main_code_ext.Rmd`: main code that implements the analysis in the paper.
  * `ESC_prototype.R`: a prototype code for our main method, Experimental-Selection-Correction.


### Data Availability

Due to data sharing restrictions, the original data used in the paper are not publicly available.
